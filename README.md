# Mini Challenge - 1 Endpoint

<b>Name:</b> David Jimenez<br>
<b>Project:</b> Mini Challenge - 1 Endpoint <br>
<b>Date:</b> 04/01/2024 <br>
<strong>Description:</strong>
Design an API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized greeting such as "Hello, {user's name}!".  Utilize Postman to facilitate the data retrieval process. <br>
I decided to create a personalized greeting that also gives a randomized suggestion.  I used an array of strings and then randomized the index within my use of the array.<br><br>

NOTE!!!  my bin and obj folders were created after first use on my PC.  If you wish to see your first use, ERASE bin and obj  if necessary!!! <br><br>

Things to turn in: <br>
- project, zipped <br>
- github link in comments of LMS <br>
